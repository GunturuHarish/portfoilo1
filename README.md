A portfolio website is a digital platform where individuals or businesses showcase their work, achievements, skills, and experiences to potential clients, employers, or collaborators. It serves as an online resume or a professional portfolio. The effectiveness of a portfolio website depends on its content, design, functionality, and how well it aligns with the goals of its creator.
